      "summary": "At MOO I was part of a small team that got tasked to build an application with a focus on a new customer segment. It targets and caters for professional and hobbyist designers to enable them to create astonishing print products with MOO. Historically mostly ignored but very valuable customers with high potential. The intent of the application was to allow this customer segment to develop print products by using the tools they know best and are the most comfortable with (Photoshop, InDesign, …). The goal of the application is to turn PDF’s into printable products and guide the customer throughout the process. We used a Python Flask back-end that is used as a back-end for front-end, exposing a specific set of tailored rest APIs. The front-end is written in React/Mobx with a strong emphasis on mobile first. A test driven first methodology and good CI pipelines allow us to ship new features to our customers at a fast pace.",
